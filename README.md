## Description

<a href="http://jsonapi.org/" target="_blank"><img src="http://jsonapi.org/images/jsonapi.png" alt="JSON API logo" title="JSON API" align="right" width="415" height="130" /></a>

A good API is one of most effective ways to improve the experience for your clients. Standardized approaches for data formats and communication protocols increase productivity and make integration between applications smooth.

This framework agnostic package implements [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) specification version **RC4** (which is planned **to be released** on May 28, 2015 as **v1.0**) and helps focusing on core application functionality rather than on protocol implementation. It supports document structure, errors, data fetching as described in [JSON API Format](http://jsonapi.org/format/) and covers parsing and checking HTTP request parameters and headers. For instance it helps to correctly respond with ```Unsupported Media Type``` (HTTP code 415) and ```Not Acceptable``` (HTTP code 406) to invalid requests. You don't need to manually validate all input parameters on every request. You can configure what parameters are supported by your services and this package will check incoming requests automatically. It greatly simplifies API development and fully support specification. In particular

* Resource attributes and relationships
* Compound documents with inclusion of related resources (circular resource references supported)
* Meta information for document, resources, errors, relationship and link objects
* Parsing HTTP ```Accept``` and ```Content-Type``` headers in accordance with RFC 2616
* Parsing parameters for pagination, sorting and filtering
* Sparse fieldsets and customized included paths
* Errors

## Sample usage

Assuming you've got an ```$author``` of type ```\Author``` you can encode it to JSON API as simple as this

```php
$encoder = Encoder::instance([
    '\Author' => '\AuthorSchema',
], new JsonEncodeOptions(JSON_PRETTY_PRINT));

echo $encoder->encode($author) . PHP_EOL;
```

will output

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "people",
        "id": "123",
        "attributes": {
            "first_name": "John",
            "last_name": "Dow"
        },
        "links": {
            "self": "http:\/\/example.com\/people\/123"
        }
    }
}
```

The ```AuthorSchema``` provides information about resource's attributes and might look like

```php
class AuthorSchema extends SchemaProvider
{
    protected $resourceType = 'people';
    protected $baseSelfUrl  = 'http://example.com/people/';

    public function getId($author)
    {
        /** @var Author $author */
        return $author->authorId;
    }

    public function getAttributes($author)
    {
        /** @var Author $author */
        return [
            'first_name' => $author->firstName,
            'last_name'  => $author->lastName,
        ];
    }
}
```
