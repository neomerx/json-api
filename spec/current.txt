Specification v1.1 (Still in Development)
Status

This page will always present the most recent text for JSON:API v1.1. Version 1.1 is a release candidate. As such, the content on this page is unlikely to change. However, some changes may still occur if implementation experience proves that they are necessary before this version is finalized.

This version is expected to be finalized and released on January 31, 2019 (provided there are two compliant implementations by that date; if not the release will wait until such implementations exist to prove its viability).

If you have concerns about the changes in this draft, catch an error in the specification’s text, or write an implementation, please let us know by opening an issue or pull request at our GitHub repository.

You can also propose additions to JSON:API in our discussion forum. Keep in mind, though, that all new versions of JSON:API must be backwards compatible using a never remove, only add strategy.
Introduction

JSON:API is a specification for how a client should request that resources be fetched or modified, and how a server should respond to those requests. JSON:API can also be easily extended with profiles.

JSON:API is designed to minimize both the number of requests and the amount of data transmitted between clients and servers. This efficiency is achieved without compromising readability, flexibility, or discoverability.

JSON:API requires use of the JSON:API media type (application/vnd.api+json) for exchanging data.
Conventions

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
Content Negotiation
Universal Responsibilities

The JSON:API media type is application/vnd.api+json. Clients and servers MUST send all JSON:API data using this media type in the Content-Type header.

Further, the JSON:API media type MUST always be specified with either no media type parameters or with only the profile parameter. This applies to both the Content-Type and Accept headers.

    Note: A media type parameter is an extra piece of information that can accompany a media type. For example, in the header Content-Type: text/html; charset="utf-8", the media type is text/html and charset is a parameter.

The profile parameter is used to support profiles.
Client Responsibilities

Clients that include the JSON:API media type in their Accept header MUST specify the media type there at least once without any media type parameters.

When processing a JSON:API response document, clients MUST ignore any parameters other than profile in the server’s Content-Type header.
Server Responsibilities

Servers MUST respond with a 415 Unsupported Media Type status code if a request specifies the header Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json with any media type parameters other than profile.

Servers MUST respond with a 406 Not Acceptable status code if a request’s Accept header contains the JSON:API media type and all instances of that media type are modified with media type parameters.

    Note: These content negotiation requirements exist to allow future versions of this specification to add other media type parameters for extension negotiation and versioning.

Document Structure

This section describes the structure of a JSON:API document, which is identified by the media type application/vnd.api+json. JSON:API documents are defined in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC8259].

Although the same media type is used for both request and response documents, certain aspects are only applicable to one or the other. These differences are called out below.

Unless otherwise noted, objects defined by this specification MUST NOT contain any additional members. Client and server implementations MUST ignore members not recognized by this specification.

    Note: These conditions allow this specification to evolve through additive changes.

Top Level

A JSON object MUST be at the root of every JSON:API request and response containing data. This object defines a document’s “top level”.

A document MUST contain at least one of the following top-level members:

    data: the document’s “primary data”
    errors: an array of error objects
    meta: a meta object that contains non-standard meta-information.

The members data and errors MUST NOT coexist in the same document.

A document MAY contain any of these top-level members:

    jsonapi: an object describing the server’s implementation
    links: a links object related to the primary data.
    included: an array of resource objects that are related to the primary data and/or each other (“included resources”).

If a document does not contain a top-level data key, the included member MUST NOT be present either.

The top-level links object MAY contain the following members:

    self: the link that generated the current response document.
    related: a related resource link when the primary data represents a resource relationship.
    profile: an array of links, each specifying a profile in use in the document.
    pagination links for the primary data.

The document’s “primary data” is a representation of the resource or collection of resources targeted by a request.

Primary data MUST be either:

    a single resource object, a single resource identifier object, or null, for requests that target single resources
    an array of resource objects, an array of resource identifier objects, or an empty array ([]), for requests that target resource collections

For example, the following primary data is a single resource object:

{
  "data": {
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "1",
    "attributes": {
      // ... this article's attributes
    },
    "relationships": {
      // ... this article's relationships
    }
  }
}

The following primary data is a single resource identifier object that references the same resource:

{
  "data": {
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "1"
  }
}

A logical collection of resources MUST be represented as an array, even if it only contains one item or is empty.
Resource Objects

“Resource objects” appear in a JSON:API document to represent resources.

A resource object MUST contain at least the following top-level members:

    id
    type

Exception: The id member is not required when the resource object originates at the client and represents a new resource to be created on the server.

In addition, a resource object MAY contain any of these top-level members:

    attributes: an attributes object representing some of the resource’s data.
    relationships: a relationships object describing relationships between the resource and other JSON:API resources.
    links: a links object containing links related to the resource.
    meta: a meta object containing non-standard meta-information about a resource that can not be represented as an attribute or relationship.

Here’s how an article (i.e. a resource of type “articles”) might appear in a document:

// ...
{
  "type": "articles",
  "id": "1",
  "attributes": {
    "title": "Rails is Omakase"
  },
  "relationships": {
    "author": {
      "links": {
        "self": "/articles/1/relationships/author",
        "related": "/articles/1/author"
      },
      "data": { "type": "people", "id": "9" }
    }
  }
}
// ...

Identification

Every resource object MUST contain an id member and a type member. The values of the id and type members MUST be strings.

Within a given API, each resource object’s type and id pair MUST identify a single, unique resource. (The set of URIs controlled by a server, or multiple servers acting as one, constitute an API.)

The type member is used to describe resource objects that share common attributes and relationships.

The values of type members MUST adhere to the same constraints as member names.

    Note: This spec is agnostic about inflection rules, so the value of type can be either plural or singular. However, the same value should be used consistently throughout an implementation.

Fields

A resource object’s attributes and its relationships are collectively called its “fields”.

Fields for a resource object MUST share a common namespace with each other and with type and id. In other words, a resource can not have an attribute and relationship with the same name, nor can it have an attribute or relationship named type or id.
Attributes

The value of the attributes key MUST be an object (an “attributes object”). Members of the attributes object (“attributes”) represent information about the resource object in which it’s defined.

Attributes may contain any valid JSON value.

Complex data structures involving JSON objects and arrays are allowed as attribute values. However, any object that constitutes or is contained in an attribute MUST NOT contain a relationships or links member, as those members are reserved by this specification for future use.

Although has-one foreign keys (e.g. author_id) are often stored internally alongside other information to be represented in a resource object, these keys SHOULD NOT appear as attributes.

    Note: See fields and member names for more restrictions on this container.

Relationships

The value of the relationships key MUST be an object (a “relationships object”). Members of the relationships object (“relationships”) represent references from the resource object in which it’s defined to other resource objects.

Relationships may be to-one or to-many.

A “relationship object” MUST contain at least one of the following:

    links: a links object containing at least one of the following:
        self: a link for the relationship itself (a “relationship link”). This link allows the client to directly manipulate the relationship. For example, removing an author through an article’s relationship URL would disconnect the person from the article without deleting the people resource itself. When fetched successfully, this link returns the linkage for the related resources as its primary data. (See Fetching Relationships.)
        related: a related resource link
    data: resource linkage
    meta: a meta object that contains non-standard meta-information about the relationship.

A relationship object that represents a to-many relationship MAY also contain pagination links under the links member, as described below. Any pagination links in a relationship object MUST paginate the relationship data, not the related resources.

    Note: See fields and member names for more restrictions on this container.

Related Resource Links

A “related resource link” provides access to resource objects linked in a relationship. When fetched, the related resource object(s) are returned as the response’s primary data.

For example, an article’s comments relationship could specify a link that returns a collection of comment resource objects when retrieved through a GET request.

If present, a related resource link MUST reference a valid URL, even if the relationship isn’t currently associated with any target resources. Additionally, a related resource link MUST NOT change because its relationship’s content changes.
Resource Linkage

Resource linkage in a compound document allows a client to link together all of the included resource objects without having to GET any URLs via links.

Resource linkage MUST be represented as one of the following:

    null for empty to-one relationships.
    an empty array ([]) for empty to-many relationships.
    a single resource identifier object for non-empty to-one relationships.
    an array of resource identifier objects for non-empty to-many relationships.

    Note: The spec does not impart meaning to order of resource identifier objects in linkage arrays of to-many relationships, although implementations may do that. Arrays of resource identifier objects may represent ordered or unordered relationships, and both types can be mixed in one response object.

For example, the following article is associated with an author:

// ...
{
  "type": "articles",
  "id": "1",
  "attributes": {
    "title": "Rails is Omakase"
  },
  "relationships": {
    "author": {
      "links": {
        "self": "http://example.com/articles/1/relationships/author",
        "related": "http://example.com/articles/1/author"
      },
      "data": { "type": "people", "id": "9" }
    }
  },
  "links": {
    "self": "http://example.com/articles/1"
  }
}
// ...

The author relationship includes a link for the relationship itself (which allows the client to change the related author directly), a related resource link to fetch the resource objects, and linkage information.
Resource Links

The optional links member within each resource object contains links related to the resource.

If present, this links object MAY contain a self link that identifies the resource represented by the resource object.

// ...
{
  "type": "articles",
  "id": "1",
  "attributes": {
    "title": "Rails is Omakase"
  },
  "links": {
    "self": "http://example.com/articles/1"
  }
}
// ...

A server MUST respond to a GET request to the specified URL with a response that includes the resource as the primary data.
Resource Identifier Objects

A “resource identifier object” is an object that identifies an individual resource.

A “resource identifier object” MUST contain type and id members.

A “resource identifier object” MAY also include a meta member, whose value is a meta object that contains non-standard meta-information.
Compound Documents

To reduce the number of HTTP requests, servers MAY allow responses that include related resources along with the requested primary resources. Such responses are called “compound documents”.

In a compound document, all included resources MUST be represented as an array of resource objects in a top-level included member.

Compound documents require “full linkage”, meaning that every included resource MUST be identified by at least one resource identifier object in the same document. These resource identifier objects could either be primary data or represent resource linkage contained within primary or included resources.

The only exception to the full linkage requirement is when relationship fields that would otherwise contain linkage data are excluded via sparse fieldsets.

    Note: Full linkage ensures that included resources are related to either the primary data (which could be resource objects or resource identifier objects) or to each other.

A complete example document with multiple included relationships:

{
  "data": [{
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "1",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "JSON:API paints my bikeshed!"
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "http://example.com/articles/1"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "author": {
        "links": {
          "self": "http://example.com/articles/1/relationships/author",
          "related": "http://example.com/articles/1/author"
        },
        "data": { "type": "people", "id": "9" }
      },
      "comments": {
        "links": {
          "self": "http://example.com/articles/1/relationships/comments",
          "related": "http://example.com/articles/1/comments"
        },
        "data": [
          { "type": "comments", "id": "5" },
          { "type": "comments", "id": "12" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }],
  "included": [{
    "type": "people",
    "id": "9",
    "attributes": {
      "firstName": "Dan",
      "lastName": "Gebhardt",
      "twitter": "dgeb"
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "http://example.com/people/9"
    }
  }, {
    "type": "comments",
    "id": "5",
    "attributes": {
      "body": "First!"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "author": {
        "data": { "type": "people", "id": "2" }
      }
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "http://example.com/comments/5"
    }
  }, {
    "type": "comments",
    "id": "12",
    "attributes": {
      "body": "I like XML better"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "author": {
        "data": { "type": "people", "id": "9" }
      }
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "http://example.com/comments/12"
    }
  }]
}

A compound document MUST NOT include more than one resource object for each type and id pair.

    Note: In a single document, you can think of the type and id as a composite key that uniquely references resource objects in another part of the document.

    Note: This approach ensures that a single canonical resource object is returned with each response, even when the same resource is referenced multiple times.

Meta Information

Where specified, a meta member can be used to include non-standard meta-information. The value of each meta member MUST be an object (a “meta object”).

Any members MAY be specified within meta objects.

For example:

{
  "meta": {
    "copyright": "Copyright 2015 Example Corp.",
    "authors": [
      "Yehuda Katz",
      "Steve Klabnik",
      "Dan Gebhardt",
      "Tyler Kellen"
    ]
  },
  "data": {
    // ...
  }
}

Links

Where specified, a links member can be used to represent links. The value of this member MUST be an object (a “links object”).

Within this object, a link MUST be represented as either:

    a string containing the link’s URI.
    an object (“link object”) which can contain the following members:
        href: a string containing the link’s URI.
        meta: a meta object containing non-standard meta-information about the link.
        Any link-specific target attributes described below.

Except for the profile key in the top-level links object and the type key in an error object’s links object, each key present in a links object MUST have a single link as its value. The aforementioned profile and type keys, if present, MUST hold an array of links.

In the example below, the self link is simply a URI string, whereas the related link uses the object form to provide meta information about a related resource collection:

"links": {
  "self": "http://example.com/articles/1",
  "related": {
    "href": "http://example.com/articles/1/comments",
    "meta": {
      "count": 10
    }
  }
}

Profile Links

Like all links, a link in an array of profile links can be represented with a link object. In that case, the link object MAY contain an aliases member listing any profile aliases.

Here, the profile key specifies an array of profile links, including one that includes a profile alias:

"links": {
  "profile": [
    "http://example.com/profiles/flexible-pagination",
    {
      "href": "http://example.com/profiles/resource-versioning",
      "aliases": {
        "version": "v"
      }
    }
  ]
}

    Note: Additional link types, similar to profile links, may be specified in the future.

JSON:API Object

A JSON:API document MAY include information about its implementation under a top level jsonapi member. If present, the value of the jsonapi member MUST be an object (a “jsonapi object”).

The jsonapi object MAY contain any of the following members:

    version - whose value is a string indicating the highest JSON:API version supported.
    meta - a meta object that contains non-standard meta-information.

A simple example appears below:

{
  "jsonapi": {
    "version": "1.1"
  }
}

If the version member is not present, clients should assume the server implements at least version 1.0 of the specification.

    Note: Because JSON:API is committed to making additive changes only, the version string primarily indicates which new features a server may support.

Member Names

All member names used in a JSON:API document MUST be treated as case sensitive by clients and servers, and they MUST meet all of the following conditions:

    Member names MUST contain at least one character.
    Member names MUST contain only the allowed characters listed below.
    Member names MUST start and end with a “globally allowed character”, as defined below.

To enable an easy mapping of member names to URLs, it is RECOMMENDED that member names use only non-reserved, URL safe characters specified in RFC 3986.
Allowed Characters

The following “globally allowed characters” MAY be used anywhere in a member name:

    U+0061 to U+007A, “a-z”
    U+0041 to U+005A, “A-Z”
    U+0030 to U+0039, “0-9”
    U+0080 and above (non-ASCII Unicode characters; not recommended, not URL safe)

Additionally, the following characters are allowed in member names, except as the first or last character:

    U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, “-“
    U+005F LOW LINE, “_”
    U+0020 SPACE, “ “ (not recommended, not URL safe)

Reserved Characters

The following characters MUST NOT be used in member names:

    U+002B PLUS SIGN, “+” (has overloaded meaning in URL query strings)
    U+002C COMMA, “,” (used as a separator between relationship paths)
    U+002E PERIOD, “.” (used as a separator within relationship paths)
    U+005B LEFT SQUARE BRACKET, “[” (used in sparse fieldsets)
    U+005D RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET, “]” (used in sparse fieldsets)
    U+0021 EXCLAMATION MARK, “!”
    U+0022 QUOTATION MARK, ‘”’
    U+0023 NUMBER SIGN, “#”
    U+0024 DOLLAR SIGN, “$”
    U+0025 PERCENT SIGN, “%”
    U+0026 AMPERSAND, “&”
    U+0027 APOSTROPHE, “’”
    U+0028 LEFT PARENTHESIS, “(“
    U+0029 RIGHT PARENTHESIS, “)”
    U+002A ASTERISK, “*”
    U+002F SOLIDUS, “/”
    U+003A COLON, “:”
    U+003B SEMICOLON, “;”
    U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN, “<”
    U+003D EQUALS SIGN, “=”
    U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN, “>”
    U+003F QUESTION MARK, “?”
    U+0040 COMMERCIAL AT, “@”
    U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS, “\”
    U+005E CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT, “^”
    U+0060 GRAVE ACCENT, “`”
    U+007B LEFT CURLY BRACKET, “{“
    U+007C VERTICAL LINE, “|”
    U+007D RIGHT CURLY BRACKET, “}”
    U+007E TILDE, “~”
    U+007F DELETE
    U+0000 to U+001F (C0 Controls)

@-Members

Member names MAY also begin with an at sign (U+0040 COMMERCIAL AT, “@”). Members named this way are called “@-Members”. @-Members MAY appear anywhere in a JSON:API document.

However, JSON:API processors MUST completely ignore @-Members (i.e. not treat them as JSON:API data).

Moreover, the existence of @-Members MUST be ignored when interpreting all JSON:API definitions and processing instructions given outside of this subsection. For example, an attribute is defined above as any member of the attributes object. However, because @-Members must be ignored when interpreting that definition, an @-Member that occurs in an attributes object is not an attribute.

    Note: Among other things, “@” members can be used to add JSON-LD data to a JSON:API document. Such documents should be served with an extra header to convey to JSON-LD clients that they contain JSON-LD data.

Fetching Data

Data, including resources and relationships, can be fetched by sending a GET request to an endpoint.

Responses can be further refined with the optional features described below.
Fetching Resources

A server MUST support fetching resource data for every URL provided as:

    a self link as part of the top-level links object
    a self link as part of a resource-level links object
    a related link as part of a relationship-level links object

For example, the following request fetches a collection of articles:

GET /articles HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

The following request fetches an article:

GET /articles/1 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

And the following request fetches an article’s author:

GET /articles/1/author HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

Responses
200 OK

A server MUST respond to a successful request to fetch an individual resource or resource collection with a 200 OK response.

A server MUST respond to a successful request to fetch a resource collection with an array of resource objects or an empty array ([]) as the response document’s primary data.

For example, a GET request to a collection of articles could return:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "links": {
    "self": "http://example.com/articles"
  },
  "data": [{
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "1",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "JSON:API paints my bikeshed!"
    }
  }, {
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "2",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "Rails is Omakase"
    }
  }]
}

A similar response representing an empty collection would be:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "links": {
    "self": "http://example.com/articles"
  },
  "data": []
}

A server MUST respond to a successful request to fetch an individual resource with a resource object or null provided as the response document’s primary data.

null is only an appropriate response when the requested URL is one that might correspond to a single resource, but doesn’t currently.

    Note: Consider, for example, a request to fetch a to-one related resource link. This request would respond with null when the relationship is empty (such that the link is corresponding to no resources) but with the single related resource’s resource object otherwise.

For example, a GET request to an individual article could return:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "links": {
    "self": "http://example.com/articles/1"
  },
  "data": {
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "1",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "JSON:API paints my bikeshed!"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "author": {
        "links": {
          "related": "http://example.com/articles/1/author"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

If the above article’s author is missing, then a GET request to that related resource would return:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "links": {
    "self": "http://example.com/articles/1/author"
  },
  "data": null
}

404 Not Found

A server MUST respond with 404 Not Found when processing a request to fetch a single resource that does not exist, except when the request warrants a 200 OK response with null as the primary data (as described above).
Other Responses

A server MAY respond with other HTTP status codes.

A server MAY include error details with error responses.

A server MUST prepare responses, and a client MUST interpret responses, in accordance with HTTP semantics.
Fetching Relationships

A server MUST support fetching relationship data for every relationship URL provided as a self link as part of a relationship’s links object.

For example, the following request fetches data about an article’s comments:

GET /articles/1/relationships/comments HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

And the following request fetches data about an article’s author:

GET /articles/1/relationships/author HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

Responses
200 OK

A server MUST respond to a successful request to fetch a relationship with a 200 OK response.

The primary data in the response document MUST match the appropriate value for resource linkage, as described above for relationship objects.

The top-level links object MAY contain self and related links, as described above for relationship objects.

For example, a GET request to a URL from a to-one relationship link could return:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "links": {
    "self": "/articles/1/relationships/author",
    "related": "/articles/1/author"
  },
  "data": {
    "type": "people",
    "id": "12"
  }
}

If the above relationship is empty, then a GET request to the same URL would return:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "links": {
    "self": "/articles/1/relationships/author",
    "related": "/articles/1/author"
  },
  "data": null
}

A GET request to a URL from a to-many relationship link could return:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "links": {
    "self": "/articles/1/relationships/tags",
    "related": "/articles/1/tags"
  },
  "data": [
    { "type": "tags", "id": "2" },
    { "type": "tags", "id": "3" }
  ]
}

If the above relationship is empty, then a GET request to the same URL would return:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "links": {
    "self": "/articles/1/relationships/tags",
    "related": "/articles/1/tags"
  },
  "data": []
}

404 Not Found

A server MUST return 404 Not Found when processing a request to fetch a relationship link URL that does not exist.

    Note: This can happen when the parent resource of the relationship does not exist. For example, when /articles/1 does not exist, request to /articles/1/relationships/tags returns 404 Not Found.

If a relationship link URL exists but the relationship is empty, then 200 OK MUST be returned, as described above.
Other Responses

A server MAY respond with other HTTP status codes.

A server MAY include error details with error responses.

A server MUST prepare responses, and a client MUST interpret responses, in accordance with HTTP semantics.
Inclusion of Related Resources

An endpoint MAY return resources related to the primary data by default.

An endpoint MAY also support an include query parameter to allow the client to customize which related resources should be returned.

If an endpoint does not support the include parameter, it MUST respond with 400 Bad Request to any requests that include it.

If an endpoint supports the include parameter and a client supplies it:

    The server’s response MUST be a compound document with an included key — even if that included key holds an empty array (because the requested relationships are empty).
    The server MUST NOT include unrequested resource objects in the included section of the compound document.

The value of the include parameter MUST be a comma-separated (U+002C COMMA, “,”) list of relationship paths. A relationship path is a dot-separated (U+002E FULL-STOP, “.”) list of relationship names.

If a server is unable to identify a relationship path or does not support inclusion of resources from a path, it MUST respond with 400 Bad Request.

    Note: For example, a relationship path could be comments.author, where comments is a relationship listed under a articles resource object, and author is a relationship listed under a comments resource object.

For instance, comments could be requested with an article:

GET /articles/1?include=comments HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

In order to request resources related to other resources, a dot-separated path for each relationship name can be specified:

GET /articles/1?include=comments.author HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

    Note: Because compound documents require full linkage (except when relationship linkage is excluded by sparse fieldsets), intermediate resources in a multi-part path must be returned along with the leaf nodes. For example, a response to a request for comments.author should include comments as well as the author of each of those comments.

    Note: A server may choose to expose a deeply nested relationship such as comments.author as a direct relationship with an alternative name such as commentAuthors. This would allow a client to request /articles/1?include=commentAuthors instead of /articles/1?include=comments.author. By exposing the nested relationship with an alternative name, the server can still provide full linkage in compound documents without including potentially unwanted intermediate resources.

Multiple related resources can be requested in a comma-separated list:

GET /articles/1?include=author,comments.author HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

Furthermore, related resources can be requested from a relationship endpoint:

GET /articles/1/relationships/comments?include=comments.author HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

In this case, the primary data would be a collection of resource identifier objects that represent linkage to comments for an article, while the full comments and comment authors would be returned as included data.

    Note: This section applies to any endpoint that responds with primary data, regardless of the request type. For instance, a server could support the inclusion of related resources along with a POST request to create a resource or relationship.

Sparse Fieldsets

A client MAY request that an endpoint return only specific fields in the response on a per-type basis by including a fields[TYPE] query parameter.

The value of any fields[TYPE] parameter MUST be a comma-separated (U+002C COMMA, “,”) list that refers to the name(s) of the fields to be returned.

If a client requests a restricted set of fields for a given resource type, an endpoint MUST NOT include additional fields in resource objects of that type in its response.

GET /articles?include=author&fields[articles]=title,body&fields[people]=name HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

    Note: The above example URI shows unencoded [ and ] characters simply for readability. In practice, these characters should be percent-encoded. See “Square Brackets in Parameter Names”.

    Note: This section applies to any endpoint that responds with resources as primary or included data, regardless of the request type. For instance, a server could support sparse fieldsets along with a POST request to create a resource.

Sorting

A server MAY choose to support requests to sort resource collections according to one or more criteria (“sort fields”).

    Note: Although recommended, sort fields do not necessarily need to correspond to resource attribute and relationship names.

    Note: It is recommended that dot-separated (U+002E FULL-STOP, “.”) sort fields be used to request sorting based upon relationship attributes. For example, a sort field of author.name could be used to request that the primary data be sorted based upon the name attribute of the author relationship.

An endpoint MAY support requests to sort the primary data with a sort query parameter. The value for sort MUST represent sort fields.

GET /people?sort=age HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

An endpoint MAY support multiple sort fields by allowing comma-separated (U+002C COMMA, “,”) sort fields. Sort fields SHOULD be applied in the order specified.

GET /people?sort=age,name HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

The sort order for each sort field MUST be ascending unless it is prefixed with a minus (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, “-“), in which case it MUST be descending.

GET /articles?sort=-created,title HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

The above example should return the newest articles first. Any articles created on the same date will then be sorted by their title in ascending alphabetical order.

If the server does not support sorting as specified in the query parameter sort, it MUST return 400 Bad Request.

If sorting is supported by the server and requested by the client via query parameter sort, the server MUST return elements of the top-level data array of the response ordered according to the criteria specified. The server MAY apply default sorting rules to top-level data if request parameter sort is not specified.

    Note: This section applies to any endpoint that responds with a resource collection as primary data, regardless of the request type.

Pagination

A server MAY choose to limit the number of resources returned in a response to a subset (“page”) of the whole set available.

A server MAY provide links to traverse a paginated data set (“pagination links”).

Pagination links MUST appear in the links object that corresponds to a collection. To paginate the primary data, supply pagination links in the top-level links object. To paginate an included collection returned in a compound document, supply pagination links in the corresponding links object.

The following keys MUST be used for pagination links:

    first: the first page of data
    last: the last page of data
    prev: the previous page of data
    next: the next page of data

Keys MUST either be omitted or have a null value to indicate that a particular link is unavailable.

Concepts of order, as expressed in the naming of pagination links, MUST remain consistent with JSON:API’s sorting rules.

The page query parameter family is reserved for pagination. Servers and clients SHOULD use these parameters for pagination operations.

    Note: JSON API is agnostic about the pagination strategy used by a server, but the page query parameter family can be used regardless of the strategy employed. For example, a page-based strategy might use query parameters such as page[number] and page[size], while a cursor-based strategy might use page[cursor].

    Note: This section applies to any endpoint that responds with a resource collection as primary data, regardless of the request type.

Filtering

The filter query parameter family is reserved for filtering data. Servers and clients SHOULD use these parameters for filtering operations.

    Note: JSON API is agnostic about the strategies supported by a server.

Creating, Updating and Deleting Resources

A server MAY allow resources of a given type to be created. It MAY also allow existing resources to be modified or deleted.

A request MUST completely succeed or fail (in a single “transaction”). No partial updates are allowed.

    Note: The type member is required in every resource object throughout requests and responses in JSON:API. There are some cases, such as when POSTing to an endpoint representing heterogenous data, when the type could not be inferred from the endpoint. However, picking and choosing when it is required would be confusing; it would be hard to remember when it was required and when it was not. Therefore, to improve consistency and minimize confusion, type is always required.

Creating Resources

A resource can be created by sending a POST request to a URL that represents a collection of resources. The request MUST include a single resource object as primary data. The resource object MUST contain at least a type member.

For instance, a new photo might be created with the following request:

POST /photos HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": {
    "type": "photos",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "Ember Hamster",
      "src": "http://example.com/images/productivity.png"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "photographer": {
        "data": { "type": "people", "id": "9" }
      }
    }
  }
}

If a relationship is provided in the relationships member of the resource object, its value MUST be a relationship object with a data member. The value of this key represents the linkage the new resource is to have.
Client-Generated IDs

A server MAY accept a client-generated ID along with a request to create a resource. An ID MUST be specified with an id key, the value of which MUST be a universally unique identifier. The client SHOULD use a properly generated and formatted UUID as described in RFC 4122 [RFC4122].

    NOTE: In some use-cases, such as importing data from another source, it may be possible to use something other than a UUID that is still guaranteed to be globally unique. Do not use anything other than a UUID unless you are 100% confident that the strategy you are using indeed generates globally unique identifiers.

For example:

POST /photos HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": {
    "type": "photos",
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "Ember Hamster",
      "src": "http://example.com/images/productivity.png"
    }
  }
}

A server MUST return 403 Forbidden in response to an unsupported request to create a resource with a client-generated ID.
Responses
201 Created

If a POST request did not include a Client-Generated ID and the requested resource has been created successfully, the server MUST return a 201 Created status code.

The response SHOULD include a Location header identifying the location of the newly created resource, in order to comply with RFC 7231.

The response MUST also include a document that contains the primary resource created.

If the resource object returned by the response contains a self key in its links member and a Location header is provided, the value of the self member MUST match the value of the Location header.

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://example.com/photos/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": {
    "type": "photos",
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "Ember Hamster",
      "src": "http://example.com/images/productivity.png"
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "http://example.com/photos/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
    }
  }
}

202 Accepted

If a request to create a resource has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed by the time the server responds, the server MUST return a 202 Accepted status code.
204 No Content

If a POST request did include a Client-Generated ID and the requested resource has been created successfully, the server MUST return either a 201 Created status code and response document (as described above) or a 204 No Content status code with no response document.

    Note: If a 204 response is received the client should consider the resource object sent in the request to be accepted by the server, as if the server had returned it back in a 201 response.

403 Forbidden

A server MAY return 403 Forbidden in response to an unsupported request to create a resource.
404 Not Found

A server MUST return 404 Not Found when processing a request that references a related resource that does not exist.
409 Conflict

A server MUST return 409 Conflict when processing a POST request to create a resource with a client-generated ID that already exists.

A server MUST return 409 Conflict when processing a POST request in which the resource object’s type is not among the type(s) that constitute the collection represented by the endpoint.

A server SHOULD include error details and provide enough information to recognize the source of the conflict.
Other Responses

A server MAY respond with other HTTP status codes.

A server MAY include error details with error responses.

A server MUST prepare responses, and a client MUST interpret responses, in accordance with HTTP semantics.
Updating Resources

A resource can be updated by sending a PATCH request to the URL that represents the resource.

The URL for a resource can be obtained in the self link of the resource object. Alternatively, when a GET request returns a single resource object as primary data, the same request URL can be used for updates.

The PATCH request MUST include a single resource object as primary data. The resource object MUST contain type and id members.

For example:

PATCH /articles/1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": {
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "1",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "To TDD or Not"
    }
  }
}

Updating a Resource’s Attributes

Any or all of a resource’s attributes MAY be included in the resource object included in a PATCH request.

If a request does not include all of the attributes for a resource, the server MUST interpret the missing attributes as if they were included with their current values. The server MUST NOT interpret missing attributes as null values.

For example, the following PATCH request is interpreted as a request to update only the title and text attributes of an article:

PATCH /articles/1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": {
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "1",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "To TDD or Not",
      "text": "TLDR; It's complicated... but check your test coverage regardless."
    }
  }
}

Updating a Resource’s Relationships

Any or all of a resource’s relationships MAY be included in the resource object included in a PATCH request.

If a request does not include all of the relationships for a resource, the server MUST interpret the missing relationships as if they were included with their current values. It MUST NOT interpret them as null or empty values.

If a relationship is provided in the relationships member of a resource object in a PATCH request, its value MUST be a relationship object with a data member. The relationship’s value will be replaced with the value specified in this member.

For instance, the following PATCH request will update the author relationship of an article:

PATCH /articles/1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": {
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "1",
    "relationships": {
      "author": {
        "data": { "type": "people", "id": "1" }
      }
    }
  }
}

Likewise, the following PATCH request performs a complete replacement of the tags for an article:

PATCH /articles/1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": {
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "1",
    "relationships": {
      "tags": {
        "data": [
          { "type": "tags", "id": "2" },
          { "type": "tags", "id": "3" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}

A server MAY reject an attempt to do a full replacement of a to-many relationship. In such a case, the server MUST reject the entire update, and return a 403 Forbidden response.

    Note: Since full replacement may be a very dangerous operation, a server may choose to disallow it. For example, a server may reject full replacement if it has not provided the client with the full list of associated objects, and does not want to allow deletion of records the client has not seen.

Responses
202 Accepted

If an update request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed by the time the server responds, the server MUST return a 202 Accepted status code.
200 OK

If a server accepts an update but also changes the resource(s) in ways other than those specified by the request (for example, updating the updated-at attribute or a computed sha), it MUST return a 200 OK response. The response document MUST include a representation of the updated resource(s) as if a GET request was made to the request URL.

A server MUST return a 200 OK status code if an update is successful, the client’s current attributes remain up to date, and the server responds only with top-level meta data. In this case the server MUST NOT include a representation of the updated resource(s).
204 No Content

If an update is successful and the server doesn’t update any attributes besides those provided, the server MUST return either a 200 OK status code and response document (as described above) or a 204 No Content status code with no response document.
403 Forbidden

A server MUST return 403 Forbidden in response to an unsupported request to update a resource or relationship.
404 Not Found

A server MUST return 404 Not Found when processing a request to modify a resource that does not exist.

A server MUST return 404 Not Found when processing a request that references a related resource that does not exist.
409 Conflict

A server MAY return 409 Conflict when processing a PATCH request to update a resource if that update would violate other server-enforced constraints (such as a uniqueness constraint on a property other than id).

A server MUST return 409 Conflict when processing a PATCH request in which the resource object’s type and id do not match the server’s endpoint.

A server SHOULD include error details and provide enough information to recognize the source of the conflict.
Other Responses

A server MAY respond with other HTTP status codes.

A server MAY include error details with error responses.

A server MUST prepare responses, and a client MUST interpret responses, in accordance with HTTP semantics.
Updating Relationships

Although relationships can be modified along with resources (as described above), JSON:API also supports updating of relationships independently at URLs from relationship links.

    Note: Relationships are updated without exposing the underlying server semantics, such as foreign keys. Furthermore, relationships can be updated without necessarily affecting the related resources. For example, if an article has many authors, it is possible to remove one of the authors from the article without deleting the person itself. Similarly, if an article has many tags, it is possible to add or remove tags. Under the hood on the server, the first of these examples might be implemented with a foreign key, while the second could be implemented with a join table, but the JSON:API protocol would be the same in both cases.

    Note: A server may choose to delete the underlying resource if a relationship is deleted (as a garbage collection measure).

Updating To-One Relationships

A server MUST respond to PATCH requests to a URL from a to-one relationship link as described below.

The PATCH request MUST include a top-level member named data containing one of:

    a resource identifier object corresponding to the new related resource.
    null, to remove the relationship.

For example, the following request updates the author of an article:

PATCH /articles/1/relationships/author HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": { "type": "people", "id": "12" }
}

And the following request clears the author of the same article:

PATCH /articles/1/relationships/author HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": null
}

If the relationship is updated successfully then the server MUST return a successful response.
Updating To-Many Relationships

A server MUST respond to PATCH, POST, and DELETE requests to a URL from a to-many relationship link as described below.

For all request types, the body MUST contain a data member whose value is an empty array or an array of resource identifier objects.

If a client makes a PATCH request to a URL from a to-many relationship link, the server MUST either completely replace every member of the relationship, return an appropriate error response if some resources can not be found or accessed, or return a 403 Forbidden response if complete replacement is not allowed by the server.

For example, the following request replaces every tag for an article:

PATCH /articles/1/relationships/tags HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": [
    { "type": "tags", "id": "2" },
    { "type": "tags", "id": "3" }
  ]
}

And the following request clears every tag for an article:

PATCH /articles/1/relationships/tags HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": []
}

If a client makes a POST request to a URL from a relationship link, the server MUST add the specified members to the relationship unless they are already present. If a given type and id is already in the relationship, the server MUST NOT add it again.

    Note: This matches the semantics of databases that use foreign keys for has-many relationships. Document-based storage should check the has-many relationship before appending to avoid duplicates.

If all of the specified resources can be added to, or are already present in, the relationship then the server MUST return a successful response.

    Note: This approach ensures that a request is successful if the server’s state matches the requested state, and helps avoid pointless race conditions caused by multiple clients making the same changes to a relationship.

In the following example, the comment with ID 123 is added to the list of comments for the article with ID 1:

POST /articles/1/relationships/comments HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": [
    { "type": "comments", "id": "123" }
  ]
}

If the client makes a DELETE request to a URL from a relationship link the server MUST delete the specified members from the relationship or return a 403 Forbidden response. If all of the specified resources are able to be removed from, or are already missing from, the relationship then the server MUST return a successful response.

    Note: As described above for POST requests, this approach helps avoid pointless race conditions between multiple clients making the same changes.

Relationship members are specified in the same way as in the POST request.

In the following example, comments with IDs of 12 and 13 are removed from the list of comments for the article with ID 1:

DELETE /articles/1/relationships/comments HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "data": [
    { "type": "comments", "id": "12" },
    { "type": "comments", "id": "13" }
  ]
}

    Note: RFC 7231 specifies that a DELETE request may include a body, but that a server may reject the request. This spec defines the semantics of a server, and we are defining its semantics for JSON:API.

Responses
202 Accepted

If a relationship update request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed by the time the server responds, the server MUST return a 202 Accepted status code.
204 No Content

A server MUST return a 204 No Content status code if an update is successful and the representation of the resource in the request matches the result.

    Note: This is the appropriate response to a POST request sent to a URL from a to-many relationship link when that relationship already exists. It is also the appropriate response to a DELETE request sent to a URL from a to-many relationship link when that relationship does not exist.

200 OK

If a server accepts an update but also changes the targeted relationship(s) in other ways than those specified by the request, it MUST return a 200 OK response. The response document MUST include a representation of the updated relationship(s).

A server MUST return a 200 OK status code if an update is successful, the client’s current data remain up to date, and the server responds only with top-level meta data. In this case the server MUST NOT include a representation of the updated relationship(s).
403 Forbidden

A server MUST return 403 Forbidden in response to an unsupported request to update a relationship.
Other Responses

A server MAY respond with other HTTP status codes.

A server MAY include error details with error responses.

A server MUST prepare responses, and a client MUST interpret responses, in accordance with HTTP semantics.
Deleting Resources

An individual resource can be deleted by making a DELETE request to the resource’s URL:

DELETE /photos/1 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

Responses
202 Accepted

If a deletion request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed by the time the server responds, the server MUST return a 202 Accepted status code.
204 No Content

A server MUST return a 204 No Content status code if a deletion request is successful and no content is returned.
200 OK

A server MUST return a 200 OK status code if a deletion request is successful and the server responds with only top-level meta data.
404 NOT FOUND

A server SHOULD return a 404 Not Found status code if a deletion request fails due to the resource not existing.
Other Responses

A server MAY respond with other HTTP status codes.

A server MAY include error details with error responses.

A server MUST prepare responses, and a client MUST interpret responses, in accordance with HTTP semantics.
Query Parameters
Query Parameter Families

Although “query parameter” is a common term in everyday web development, it is not a well-standardized concept. Therefore, JSON:API provides its own definition of a query parameter.

For the most part, JSON:API’s definition coincides with colloquial usage, and its details can be safely ignored. However, one important consequence of this definition is that a URL like the following is considered to have two distinct query parameters:

/?page[offset]=0&page[limit]=10

The two parameters are named page[offset] and page[limit]; there is no single page parameter.

In practice, however, parameters like page[offset] and page[limit] are usually defined and processed together, and it’s convenient to refer to them collectively. Therefore, JSON:API introduces the concept of a query parameter family.

A “query parameter family” is the set of all query parameters whose name starts with a “base name”, followed by zero or more instances of empty square brackets (i.e. []) or square-bracketed legal member names. The family is referred to by its base name.

For example, the filter query parameter family includes parameters named: filter, filter[x], filter[], filter[x][], filter[][], filter[x][y], etc. However, filter[_] is not a valid parameter name in the family, because _ is not a valid member name.
Implementation-Specific Query Parameters

Implementations MAY support custom query parameters. However, the names of these query parameters MUST come from a family whose base name is a legal member name and also contains at least one non a-z character (i.e., outside U+0061 to U+007A).

It is RECOMMENDED that a capital letter (e.g. camelCasing) be used to satisfy the above requirement.

If a server encounters a query parameter that does not follow the naming conventions above, and the server does not know how to process it as a query parameter from this specification, it MUST return 400 Bad Request.

    Note: By forbidding the use of query parameters that contain only the characters [a-z], JSON:API is reserving the ability to standardize additional query parameters later without conflicting with existing implementations.

Profiles

JSON:API supports the use of “profiles” as a way to indicate additional semantics that apply to a JSON:API request/document, without altering the basic semantics described in this specification.

A profile is a separate specification defining these additional semantics.

RFC 6906 covers the nature of profile identification:

    Profiles are identified by URI… The presence of a specific URI has to be sufficient for a client to assert that a resource representation conforms to a profile [regardless of any content that may or may not be available at that URI].

However, to aid human understanding, visiting a profile’s URI SHOULD return documentation of the profile.

The following example profile reserves a timestamps member in the meta object of every resource object:

# Timestamps profile

## Introduction

This page specifies a profile for the `application/vnd.api+json` media type,
as described in the [JSON:API specification](http://jsonapi.org/format/).

This profile allows every resource in a JSON:API document to represent
significant timestamps in a consistent way.

## Document Structure

Every resource object **MAY** include a `timestamps` member in its associated
`meta` object. If this member is present, its value **MUST** be an object that
**MAY** contain any of the following members:

* `created`
* `updated`

The value of each member **MUST** comply with the variant of ISO 8601 used by
JavaScript's `JSON.stringify` method to format Javascript `Date` objects.

## Keywords

This profile defines the following keywords:

* `timestamps`

profile Media Type Parameter

The profile media type parameter is used to describe the application of one or more profiles to a JSON:API document. The value of the profile parameter MUST equal a space-separated (U+0020 SPACE, “ “) list of profile URIs.

    Note: When serializing the profile media type parameter, the HTTP specification requires that its value be surrounded by quotation marks (U+0022 QUOTATION MARK, “"”) if it contains more than one URI.

A client MAY use the profile media type parameter in conjunction with the JSON:API media type in an Accept header to request, but not require, that the server apply one or more profiles to the response document. When such a request is received, a server SHOULD attempt to apply the requested profiles to its response.

For example, in the following request, the client asks that the server apply the http://example.com/last-modified profile if it is able to.

Accept: application/vnd.api+json;profile="http://example.com/last-modified", application/vnd.api+json

    Note: The second instance of the JSON:API media type in the example above is required under the client’s content negotiation responsibilities. It is used to support old servers that don’t understand the profile parameter.

Servers MAY add profiles to a JSON:API document even if the client has not requested them. The recipient of a document MUST ignore any profiles in that document that it does not understand. The only exception to this is profiles whose support is required using the profile query parameter, as described later.
Sending Profiled Documents

Clients and servers MUST include the profile media type parameter in conjunction with the JSON:API media type in a Content-Type header to indicate that they have applied one or more profiles to a JSON:API document.

Likewise, clients and servers applying profiles to a JSON:API document MUST include a top-level links object with a profile key, and that profile key MUST include a link to the URI of each profile that has been applied.

When an older JSON:API server that doesn’t support the profile media type parameter receives a document with one or more profiles, it will respond with a 415 Unsupported Media Type error.

After attempting to rule out other possible causes of this error, a client that receives a 415 Unsupported Media Type SHOULD remove the profiles it has applied to the document and retry its request without the profile media type parameter. If this resolves the error, the client SHOULD NOT attempt to apply profiles in subsequent interactions with the same API.

    The most likely other causes of a 415 error are that the server doesn’t support JSON:API at all or that the client has failed to provide a required profile.

profile Query Parameter

A client MAY use the profile query parameter to require the server to apply one or more profiles when processing the request. The value of the profile query parameter MUST equal a URI-encoded whitespace-separated list of profile URIs.

If a server receives a request requiring the application of a profile or combination of profiles that it can not apply, it MUST respond with a 400 Bad Request status code. The response MUST contain an error object that identifies the profile query parameter as the source and has the following URI as (one of) its types:

https://jsonapi.org/errors/profile-not-supported

    Note: When a client lists a profile in the Accept header, it’s asking the server to compute its response as normal, but then send the response document with some extra information, as described in the requested profile. By contrast, when a client lists a profile in the profile query parameter, it’s asking the server to process the incoming request according to the rules of the profile. This can fundamentally change the meaning of the server’s response.

Omitting the profile Query Parameter

Requiring the client to specify the profile query parameter would be cumbersome. Accordingly, JSON:API defines a way that server’s may infer its value in many cases.

To do so, a server MAY define an internal mapping from query parameter names to profile URIs. The profile URI for a query parameter name in this mapping MUST NOT change over time.

    Note: the server may choose to map all query parameter names from the same family to one profile URI. Or, it may choose to map only specific query parameter names.

If a requested URL does not contain the profile query parameter and does contain one or more query parameters in the server’s internal mapping, the server may act as though the request URL contained a profile query parameter whose value was the URI-encoded space-separated list of each unique profile URI found in the server’s internal mapping for the query parameters in use on the request.

For example, the server might support a profile that defines a meaning for the values of the page[cursor] query parameter. Then, it could define its internal param name to profile URI mapping like so:

{ "page[cursor]": "https://example.com/pagination-profile" }

Accordingly, a request for:

https://example.com/?page[cursor]=xyz

would be interpreted by the server as:

https://example.com/?page[cursor]=xyz&profile=https://example.com/pagination-profile

Profile Keywords and Aliases

A profile SHOULD explicitly declare “keywords” for any elements that it introduces to the document structure. If a profile does not explicitly declare a keyword for an element, then the name of the element itself (i.e., its key in the document) is considered to be its keyword. All profile keywords MUST meet this specification’s requirements for member names.

For the purposes of aliasing, a profile’s elements are defined shallowly. In other words, if a profile introduces an object-valued document member, that member is an element (and so subject to aliasing), but any keys in it are not themselves elements. Likewise, if the profile defines an array-valued element, the keys in nested objects within that array are not elements.

The following example profile defines a single keyword, version:

# Resource versioning profile

## Introduction

This page specifies a profile for the `application/vnd.api+json` media type,
as described in the [JSON:API specification](http://jsonapi.org/format/).

This profile ensures that every resource represented in a JSON:API document
includes a version.

## Document Structure

Every resource **MUST** include a `meta` object containing a `version` member.
The value of this member **MUST** be a string that represents a unique version
for that resource.

## Keywords

This profile defines the following keywords:

* `version`

This profile might be applied as follows:

{
  "data": {
    "type": "contacts",
    "id": "345",
    "meta": {
      "version": "2018-04-14-879976658"
    },
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Ethan"
    }
  },
  "links": {
    "profile": ["http://example.com/profiles/resource-versioning"]
  }
}

Documents that apply a particular profile MAY represent each keyword with an alternatively named member, or “alias”. An alias fully assumes any meaning specified for a keyword, which no longer retains that meaning. Any aliases associated with a profile MUST be represented in the profile’s corresponding aliases object within its link object. The key of each alias MUST be a keyword from the profile, and the value MUST be an alias that applies to this particular representation. This aliasing mechanism allows profiles to be applied in a way that is both consistent with the rest of the representation and does not conflict with other profiles.

For instance, the following document provides an alias for version: v. Interpreters of this representation should treat the key v as if it were the key version described in the profile:

{
  "data": {
    "type": "contacts",
    "id": "345",
    "meta": {
      "v": "2018-04-14-879976658"
    },
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Ethan"
    }
  },
  "links": {
    "profile": [{
      "href": "http://example.com/profiles/resource-versioning",
      "aliases": {
        "version": "v"
      }
    }]
  }
}

Processing Profiled Documents/Requests

When a profile is applied to a request and/or document, the value used for each of the profile’s document members or query parameters is said to be “a recognized value” if that value, including all parts of it, has a legal, defined meaning according to the latest revision of the profile that the application is aware of.

    Note: The set of recognized values is also/more technically known as the defined text set.

For example, the hypothetical timestamps profile specifies the timestamps element, and the meaning for two keys within it – created and updated. Therefore, in the following use of the profile, the value for the timestamps element would be a recognized value:

{
  "type": "contacts",
  "id": "345",
  "meta": {
    "timestamps": { "created": "2018-08-29T18:38:17.567Z" }
  }
  //...
}

However, in the following case, the value for timestamps is not a recognized value because one of the keys in it, createdUnixEpoch, doesn’t have a meaning assigned to it in the timestamps profile:

{
    "type": "contacts",
    "id": "345",
    "meta": {
      "timestamps": {
        "createdUnixEpoch": 1535567910201,
        "created": "2018-08-29T18:38:17.567Z"
      }
    }
    //...
  }

Likewise, if a profile defines an element and enumerates true and false as legal values with a specific meaning, then a string appearing as that element’s value would be an unrecognized value.

    Note: unrecognized values are not necessarily invalid or erroneous values. For example, the timestamps profile might be revised later to actually define a “createdUnixEpoch” key. This key would be unrecognized by all applications that existed at the time it was defined, but not by ones created/deployed later.

Each profile MAY define its own rules for how applications should proceed when encountering unrecognized values.

If a profile does not define its own rules for handling unrecognized values, the following rule applies by default:

    If the value of a profile-defined query parameter is unrecognized, the server MUST fail the request and respond with a 400 Bad Request and an error object indicating the problematic parameter.

    Otherwise, if the unrecognized value is a JSON object in the request/response document, and the only thing that makes it unrecognized is that it contains one or more keys that have no meaning assigned to them (in the latest revision of the profile that the application is aware of), then the application MUST simply ignore those unknown keys and continue processing the profile.

    In all other cases, the application MUST assume that the profile has been applied erroneously and MUST totally ignore the profile (i.e., process the request as if the profile were not there).

In the case of our example timestamps profile, it does not define its own rules, so the above defaults would apply.

Under the second of these default rules, the unrecognized value we saw above (with the createdUnixEpoch key) would be processed as though the createdUnixEpoch key simply weren’t present, and the application would still be able to use the data in the created key.

However, if the user instead provided the following value, the whole timestamps profile would need to be ignored:

{
  //...
  "timestamps": {
    "updated": "Wed Aug 29 2018 15:00:05 GMT-0400",
    "created": "2018-08-29T18:38:17.567Z"
  }
}

Ignoring the profile in this case is required by the third default rule, because the value for the updated key is not recognized under the profile’s requirement that the updated key hold a string of the form produced by JSON.stringify.
Authoring Profiles

A profile MAY assign meaning to elements of the document structure whose use is left up to each implementation, such as resource fields or members of meta objects. A profile MUST NOT define/assign a meaning to document members in areas of the document reserved for future use by the JSON:API specification.

For example, it would be illegal for a profile to define a new key in a document’s top-level object, or in a links object, as JSON API implementations are not allowed to add custom keys in those areas.

Likewise, a profile MAY assign a meaning to query parameters or parameter values whose details are left up to each implementation, such as filter and all parameters that contain a non a-z character. However, profiles MUST NOT assign a meaning to query parameters that are reserved.

The meaning of an element or query parameter defined by a profile MUST NOT vary based on the presence or absence of other profiles.

The scope of a profile MUST be clearly delineated. The elements and query parameters specified by a profile, and their meanings, MUST NOT change over time or else the profile MUST be considered a new profile with a new URI.

    Note: When a profile changes its URI, a huge amount of interoperability is lost. Users that reference the new URI will not have their messages understood by implementations still aware only of the old URI, and vice-versa. Accordingly, it’s important to design your profile so that it can evolve without its URI needing to change. See “Revising a Profile” for details.

Finally, a profile MUST NOT:

    assume that, if it is supported, then other specific profiles will be supported as well.

    define fixed endpoints, HTTP headers, or header values.

    alter the JSON structure of any concept defined in this specification, including to allow a superset of JSON structures.

    If you create your own profile, you are strongly encouraged to register it with the JSON API profile registry, so that others can find and reuse it.

Revising a Profile

Profiles MAY be revised over time, e.g., to add new capabilities. However, any such changes MUST be backwards and forwards compatible (“compatible evolution”), in order to not break existing users of the profile.

For example, the hypothetical timestamps profile could not introduce a new, required deleted member within the timestamps object, as that would be incompatible with existing deployments of the profile, which would not include this new member.

The timestamps profile also could not evolve to define a new element as a sibling of the timestamps key, as that would be incompatible with the rule that “The elements… specified by a profile… MUST NOT change over time.”

    The practical issue with adding a sibling element is that another profile in use on the document might already define a sibling element of the same name, and existing documents would not have any aliases defined to resolve this conflict.

However, the timestamps profile could evolve to allow other optional members, such as deleted, in the timestamps object. This is possible because the timestamps object is already a reserved element of the profile, and the profile is subject to the default rule that new (previously unrecognized) keys will simply be ignored by existing applications.
Designing Profiles to Evolve Over Time

Fundamentally, for a profile to be able to change in a compatible way over time, it must define – from the beginning – a rule describing how an application that is only familiar with the original version of the profile should process documents/requests that use features from an updated version of the profile.

One major approach is to simply have applications ignore (at least some types of) unrecognized data. This allows the profile to define new, optional features; old applications will continue to work, but simply won’t process/”see” these new capabilities.

This is essentially the strategy that JSON:API itself uses when it says that:

    Client and server implementations MUST ignore members not recognized by this specification.

Other protocols use analogous strategies. E.g., in HTTP, unknown headers are simply ignored; they don’t crash the processing of the request/response.

As a profile author, you may define your own rules for how applications should process uses of the profile that contain unrecognized data, or you may simply allow the default rules described in the “Processing Profiled Documents/Requests” to take effect.

If you choose to use the default rules, you SHOULD reserve an object-valued element anywhere you expect to potentially add new features over time.
Errors
Processing Errors

A server MAY choose to stop processing as soon as a problem is encountered, or it MAY continue processing and encounter multiple problems. For instance, a server might process multiple attributes and then return multiple validation problems in a single response.

When a server encounters multiple problems for a single request, the most generally applicable HTTP error code SHOULD be used in the response. For instance, 400 Bad Request might be appropriate for multiple 4xx errors or 500 Internal Server Error might be appropriate for multiple 5xx errors.
Error Objects

Error objects provide additional information about problems encountered while performing an operation. Error objects MUST be returned as an array keyed by errors in the top level of a JSON:API document.

An error object MAY have the following members:

    id: a unique identifier for this particular occurrence of the problem.
    links: a links object containing the following members:
        about: a link that leads to further details about this particular occurrence of the problem. When derefenced, this URI SHOULD return a human-readable description of the error.
        type: an array of links that identify the type of error that this particular error is an instance of. This URI SHOULD be dereferencable to a human-readable explanation of the general error.
    status: the HTTP status code applicable to this problem, expressed as a string value.
    code: an application-specific error code, expressed as a string value.
    title: a short, human-readable summary of the problem that SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem, except for purposes of localization.
    detail: a human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem. Like title, this field’s value can be localized.
    source: an object containing references to the source of the error, optionally including any of the following members:
        pointer: a JSON Pointer [RFC6901] to the value in the request document that caused the error [e.g. "/data" for a primary data object, or "/data/attributes/title" for a specific attribute]. This MUST point to a value in the request document that exists; if it doesn’t, the client SHOULD simply ignore the pointer.
        parameter: a string indicating which URI query parameter caused the error.
    meta: a meta object containing non-standard meta-information about the error.

Appendix
Query Parameters Details
Parsing/Serialization

A query parameter is a name–value pair extracted from, or serialized into, a URI’s query string.

To extract the query parameters from a URI, an implementation MUST run the URI’s query string, excluding the leading question mark, through the application/x-www-form-urlencoded parsing algorithm, with one exception: JSON:API allows the specification that defines a query parameter’s usage to provide its own rules for parsing the parameter’s value from the value bytes identified in steps 3.2 and and 3.3 of the application/x-www-form-urlencoded parsing algorithm. The resulting value might not be a string.

    Note: In general, the query string parsing built in to servers and browsers will match the process specified above, so most implementations do not need to worry about this.

    The application/x-www-form-urlencoded format is referenced because it is the basis for the a=b&c=d style that almost all query strings use today.

    However, application/x-www-form-urlencoded parsing contains the bizarre historical artifact that + characters must be treated as spaces, and it requires that all values be percent-decoded during parsing, which makes it impossible to use RFC 3986 delimiter characters as delimiters. These issues motivate the exception that JSON:API defines above.

Similarly, to serialize a query parameter into a URI, an implementation MUST use the the application/x-www-form-urlencoded serializer, with the corresponding exception that a parameter’s value — but not its name — may be serialized differently than that algorithm requires, provided the serialization does not interfere with the ability to parse back the resulting URI.
Square Brackets in Parameter Names

With query parameter families, JSON:API allows for query parameters whose names contain square brackets (i.e., U+005B “[” and U+005D “]”).

According to the query parameter serialization rules above, a compliant implementation will percent-encode these square brackets. However, some URI producers — namely browsers — do not always encode them. Servers SHOULD accept requests in which these square brackets are left unencoded in a query parameter’s name. If a server does accept these requests, it MUST treat the request as equivalent to one in which the square brackets were percent-encoded.
